    "[Retrieval Agents](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/conversational_retrieval_agents) are useful when we want to make decisions about whether to retrieve from an index. Here we construct the same single index of 10Ks with metadata that we tried in notebook 04.\n",

However, there is no specific figure mentioned for Apple's total revenue in 2022.\n\nInstead, I'll focus on the other relevant information provided in the Form 10-K. In Note 3 – Financial Instruments: Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities, we see that as of September 24, 2022, Apple had a total of $183,061 million (Fair Value) in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\n\nThis figure is not directly related to revenue, but it gives an idea of the company's liquidity and financial position. Unfortunately, this information does not provide a direct answer to your question about Apple's revenue for 2022.\n\nTo find the exact revenue figure, you may need to look at Apple's annual report or quarterly earnings releases for 2022, which are publicly available on their investor relations website or through other financial databases.`",

Form 10-K for 2022, I will attempt to answer your question about Apple's revenue for 2022.\n\nFrom the \"Segment Information and Geographic Data\" note in the Form 10-K (Note 11), we can see that Apple's net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent across reportable segments in 2022. However, there is no specific figure mentioned for Apple's total revenue in 2022.\n\nInstead, I'll focus on the other relevant information provided in the Form 10-K. In Note 3 – Financial Instruments: Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities, we see that as of September 24, 2022, Apple had a total of $183,061 million (Fair Value) in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\n\nThis figure is not directly related to revenue, but it gives an idea of the company's liquidity and financial position. Unfortunately, this information does not provide a direct answer to your question about Apple's revenue for 2022.\n\nTo find the exact revenue figure, you may need to look at Apple's annual report or quarterly earnings releases for 2022, which are publicly available on their investor relations website or through other financial databases.`"
