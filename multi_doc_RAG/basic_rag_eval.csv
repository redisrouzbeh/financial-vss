2,How does competition in the market affect the supply of components for the Company's products?,"Question: How does competition in the market affect the supply of components for the Company's products?
Answer: Competition has been intense and aggressive, with competitors cutting prices and lowering product margins. This can lead to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations, affecting the Company's ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
Source: Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 8","['Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry- wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry is experiencing high demand and shortages of supply, which has adversely affected, and could materially adversely affect, the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “The Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition,” above, can also affect the Company’s ability to obtain components. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.'

 'The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\n\nSupply of Components\n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\n\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.'

Answer: We're continuing to add to our AWS sales and marketing teams, seeing great opportunity there to help customers engage with our services and migrate to our products. We're also adding more advertising as we roll out devices and Prime Video... So we're seeing higher marketing costs. (Source: Amazon.com, Inc. 10-K filing, page 14)

 ""First, we're continuing to add to our AWS sales and marketing teams. We see great opportunity there to help customers engage with our services and migrate to our products. So we continue to build out our sales force and our marketing programs. We're also adding more and more advertising as we roll out devices and Prime Video -- new Prime Video content, in particular internationally. So we're seeing higher marketing costs. We're also seeing a higher stock-based compensation expense. That was up 36% year-over-year. And you'll see that our headcount grew 13% year-over-year. So when you look at some of our most quickly growing areas, things like Alexa and AWS and also teams working on machine learning and other high-end technical projects, our technical headcount actually grew twice that rate or nearly twice that rate based on the total headcount. So there's a lot of moving parts within our headcount number, but there's a very strong investment going on in AWS, devices and videos, in particular.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator    [21] --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOur next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ross Adam Sandler,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Equity Research & Senior Internet Analyst    [22] --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHey guys, just 2 questions. The North America retail acceleration, 3.5 points, and you mentioned that international is about 1. So can we attribute the difference to one-day? Or was there other organic acceleration in North America happening aside from the move to one-day? And then, Brian, related to that investing question, AWS operating margin came down a bit. I know they had a tough comp. But anything you would call out aside from the headcount stuff that you just mentioned that may have been lumpy in the quarter on AWS?\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [23] --------------------------------------------------------------------------------""
 ""Yes, let me talk a little more broadly about advertising. So yes, we are seeing really strong adoption across a number of groups, Amazon vendors and sellers, for sure, authors as well as third-party advertisers who want to reach Amazon customers. As far as penetration, we don't have that quantified for you, but we still believe that there is a lot of room to continue to improve the presentation of bringing to our customers new and more relevant purchase options. So we don't think -- we'll continue to invent both on the product side, the tools side, with our goal being improve the usability of the tools for advertisers, make smarter recommendations for customers, automate activities so that advertisers don't have to work as hard and invent new products for advertisers. If we do this right, we think we'll both help advertisers and help Amazon consumers at the same time. So don't have -- I know it doesn't answer your question about specific rate increases or capacity, but that is the general strategy that we're seeing in advertising.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [34] --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYes, and this is Dave, just jumping in on the Alexa point. I mean, I think the short answer is we don't have any plans to add paid advertising to Alexa. I think we clearly had a lot of exciting things happen in the last month or 2 in terms of new announcements and devices out there. And I mean, I think really looking at that, the goal is make customers lives easier and make it more convenient. And a lot of that is you're seeing that in homes, and to some extent, on the go. So I think if you look at the recent announcements, you've seen a few things. I mean, one, we're bringing a lot of cool hardware options to customers. Second thing, I mean, making the Alexa service smarter -- just getting smarter and more capable. And then also delivering tools for developers, helping them build for and really with Alexa. So I think making her smarter and seeing that she gets smarter with all the skills, leveraging the cloud and AI, becoming more knowledgeable, and introducing a lot of really cool new features. So really excited about the customer response with those devices and those tools so far and looking forward to doing even more.""
 ""Maybe if you could just remind us of the thinking that -- behind keeping AWS and retail under one corporate structure. And does it make sense given the scale of where AWS is right now? And then -- and I'm sorry I have a little bit of an echo, I don't know why, but -- and we're hearing from marketers just how important Amazon is to their media strategy. So I don't know if you could just maybe talk about that a little bit more broadly in terms of the approach and your philosophy to that business.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [33] --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSure. We see a lot of value in all of our businesses. And AWS is a key component as is the physical consumer business. The -- what I'll point out is the management team is a common management team. The consumer business, if you will, is, if not the biggest, one of the largest customers of AWS. So we see a lot of commonality there where we as -- depending on position in the company. On the consumer side, the use of AWS has driven great infrastructure efficiencies, just like other companies see when they use AWS, turning fixed cost into variable cost and pooling resources and not having a lot of trapped capacity throughout the company and taking advantage of all the new services and features. So as a internal customer, the consumer business is very happy with AWS. And I think AWS is also very benefited by the fact that they have a large internal beta customer that tries out and uses a lot of their products and services. So it's a good combination for a lot of reasons, and we see no reason to change the structure that we have.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDave Fildes,\n\n[34]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYes.

5,How does the determination of the discount rate for lease liabilities relate to the Company's incremental borrowing rate and the inability to readily determine the implicit discount rates in the Company's leases?,"Based on the provided context from financial 10K filings data, it can be inferred that the discount rate used to calculate the present value of lease liabilities is based on the company's incremental borrowing rate. This is because the filing states that the discount rate for lease liabilities is ""based on similarly secured borrowings available to us,"" which implies that the company's incremental borrowing rate is being used as a proxy for the implicit discount rates in its leases.

The filing does not explicitly state how the determination of the discount rate relates to the company's incremental borrowing rate, but it can be inferred that the company's incremental borrowing rate is being used as a basis for estimating the implicit discount rates in its leases. This makes sense because the incremental borrowing rate reflects the company's cost of capital and would likely be a reasonable estimate of the implicit discount rates in its leases.

In summary, the determination of the discount rate for lease liabilities relates to the company's incremental borrowing rate in that it is based on similarly secured borrowings available to the company.","['The discount rate related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of both September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 was 2.0%. The discount rates are generally based on estimates of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily determined.\n\nAs of September 25, 2021, the Company had $1.1 billion of future payments under additional leases, primarily for corporate facilities and retail space, that had not yet commenced.

Answer: Tariffs can make the Company's products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company's products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.

Trade and other international disputes can result in tariffs, sanctions, and other measures that restrict international trade and can adversely affect the Company’s business. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products.

These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company’s operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company’s operations and distracting to management.
