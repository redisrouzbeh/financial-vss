1,What percentage increase in Services revenue did Apple report in 2023?,"According to the context from financial 10K filings data:

Services net sales increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to higher net sales from advertising, cloud services and the App Store.

The question asks for the percentage increase in Services revenue in 2023. Since we don't have the exact figure for 2021's Services revenue, we can only find the change in Services revenue between 2022 and 2023:

Rest of Asia Paciﬁc net sales increased 1% or $240 million during 2023 compared to 2022.

This increase is partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and iPad. Since Services revenue is mentioned as one of the contributors to this increase, we can assume that the percentage increase in Services revenue is around 9%, which is the same percentage increase for

 ""--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLuca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO    [62]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRod, let me give you some details both on a sequential basis, and I'll give you also something on a year-over-year basis because maybe that's where the disconnect comes from looking at last year's gross margins in the December quarter. \nOn a sequential basis, we're essentially guiding to some improvement in gross margins. We had 38% both in the June quarter and in the September quarter. We're guiding slightly higher for the December quarter because on the positive we're going to have, of course, better leverage and the mix in the December quarter tends to be better. But, we need to keep into account the fact that these positives are going to be partially offset by the cost structures of the new products that we are launching now, and we launched already a few during the September quarter and that will have an impact on our December-quarter results. \nOn a year-over-year basis, keep in mind that last year we did in Q1 we did 40%, around 40%, 41%.  But, there's a couple of things that I think need to be considered before doing a year-over-year compare. And, it's a fact that last year we had this award for a patent infringement of $548 million that is at the gross margin level is 40 Bps. \nAnd then, we've got the FX situation which I mentioned before which is worth another 60, 70 Bps. And so, you're left with less than 100 basis points deterioration on a year-over-year basis where, again, we have the reality of new cost structures into our products. \nIt is very, very important, I think, for investors to understand that what's happened during the last two years. During the last two years the US dollar has appreciated by 15% over the basket of currencies where we do business. And, we are a Company that generates two-thirds of our revenues outside the United States. 15% appreciation of the US dollar. So, on a year-over-year basis, just 2016 over 2015, was 340 Bps impact from foreign exchange. \nThis is something that we have offset almost entirely through a number of initiatives going from pricing actions to cost initiatives to our hedging program.  But, at some point, the strong dollar becomes the new normal, and we need to work with that.  And, I think over the years, we have made very good tradeoffs, and our gross margins have been quite stable over time. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRod  Hall,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [63]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOkay. Great. Thanks, Luca. And then, Tim, I wanted to ask you, this question comes up once in a while.  But, I just wanted to ask you if you could talk to us a little bit about the arguments on both sides of the dividend question. \nApple seems to be perpetually undervalued. It's a very large Company.  It is getting harder and harder to grow. Your payout ratio is significantly below the S&P 500. I know you can't tell us what your intentions are here, but if you could help us understand how that thinking around the dividend works it would be great. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [64]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWe review the capital return annually, and we've established a cadence now to announce our thinking on that every April. So, we have a robust discussion around the dividend and the buyback. \nWe very much believe that Apple is very undervalued, and so we're investing with confidence in the Company that we know really well. And so, that thinking has I think proven out over time, and I think been very good for our shareholders. And, in addition to that, we know that some shareholders really like a dividend and some ongoing income, and so we provided an amount that we think is a good amount and have a good track record of raising it annually. And so, we'll be able to say more on that I'm sure in April of next year. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRod  Hall,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [65]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThank you.""

 ""--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTimothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [15]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWell, Mike, it's Tim. The -- again, the great thing about Services is there are several services that make up the total that are growing nicely. And I think the other good news is that because our active installed base has -- is at such a level at -- last quarter, we said that we had exceeded $1.3 billion. This year, we're -- we're not going to release this number every quarter, but we've obviously grown again. And it's growing at a double-digit number on a year-over-year basis. And so with that kind of change in the installed base and with the services that we have now and others that we are working on, I think that this is just a huge opportunity for us and feel very good about the track that we're on.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMichael Joseph Olson,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst    [16]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnd then any potential tariff issues aside, what's working for Apple in China right now? You talked about it being the strongest year-over-year growth in 10 quarters. I guess, what's driving that? Is it iPhone X specifically or something else that's behind that improvement?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTimothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [17]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA good question. IPhone X was the most popular smartphone in all of China last quarter. And so iPhone X has done well there. In order to hit a number like 21% on the growth that you see on your data sheet there, there has to be several things working well. And the things that have huge growth rates there are the other products category, which is our Wearables business in China and the Services business, which you and I just spoke about. The iPhone obviously had to do extremely well to get a 21% number, and we gained share in the market for the Mac as well. And so there's actually several vectors there that are working well for us. We also -- more broadly on the iPhone, the iPhone was the top 3 selling phones in China. And so it's iPhone X was #1, but we had several in the top.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [18]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFrom RBC Capital Markets, Amit Daryanani.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAmit Jawaharlaz Daryanani,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst    [19]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTwo questions from me as well. I guess, first one, just touching on the gross margin dynamics. If I look at the guidance for June on a year-over-year basis, I think sales are up double digit, but gross margins are still flat at the high end, maybe down 20 basis points at the midpoint. Can you just talk about what's driving the lack of leverage on the gross margin basis on a year-over-year basis for June?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLuca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [20]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYes. Amit, it's Luca. We tend to look at the -- our gross margin dynamics on a sequential basis, and essentially, we're guiding to about flat on a sequential basis. On a year-over-year basis, it's less relevant for our business, but in general, I would say that this year we are seeing a more difficult cost environment. Particularly, we're still dealing with about 70 basis points of the impact from the memory pricing environment that we're working through.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAmit Jawaharlaz Daryanani,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst    [21]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGot it. And if I could just follow up, Tim, you've been fairly vocal, I think, talking about the need for better privacy protection and well-crafted regulation over time. Could you just maybe help us understand how does Apple protect consumer data? And how does this ongoing debate around data protection translate into a positive for Apple over time?""
 ""Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with the March quarter results. Revenue for the quarter landed within our guidance range at $50.6 billion, compared to $58 billion in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 13%. \nAs we had expected, our comparisons to last year were influenced by the continued strength of the US dollar against foreign currencies. That being said, in constant currency, our revenue declined by 9%. On a geographic basis, in Asia, our revenue grew strongly in Japan, but it declined in greater China and the rest of Asia-Pacific. \nHowever our business in these two regions is faring better than the numbers might suggest. We had significant channel inventory reductions and currency weakness, which affected our reported revenue for both of these segments. In mainland China, revenue was down 11%, and the decline was 7% in constant currency terms. Keep in mind that we were up against an extremely difficult year-ago compare, when our mainland China revenue grew 81%. We remain very optimistic about the China market over the long-term, and we are committed to investing there for the long run. \nGross margin was 39.4%, near the high-end of our guidance range, thanks to strong cost performance. Operating margin was 27.7% of revenue, and net income was $10.5 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.90, and cash flow from operations was strong, at $11.6 billion. \nFor details by product, I start with iPhone. We sold 51.2 million iPhones in the quarter, compared to 61.2 million in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 16%. It was a particularly challenging comparison to the record quarter a year ago, when iPhone 6 grew 40% as we entered last March quarter, and supply demand imbalance, which was recovered during the quarter. \nAlso, this year we reduced channel inventory by 450,000 units, while we increased inventory by 1 million units a year ago. We have exited the quarter with in our five to seven-week target range for channel  inventory. iPhone ASV was $642 compared to $659 in the year ago quarter, with weak international currencies and very popular mid-tier and entry offerings contributing to the difference year-over-year. \niPhone's momentum in business markets continues to be very impressive. A recent survey by 451 Research, formerly known as ChangeWave, found that among US corporate buyers planning to purchase smart phones in the June quarter, 78% planned to purchase iPhones. That's the highest June quarter iPhone purchase intent ever measured by the survey and 5 points higher than a year ago. \nTurning to services, we generated $6 billion in revenue, an increase of 20% over the March quarter last year, thanks primarily to the continued strong performance of the App Store, with revenue growing 35% to a new all-time high. According to App Annie, the App Store generated 90% more global revenue than Google Play in the March quarter, up from a 75% lead in 2015. Among our customers who purchased apps and content from our iTunes Stores, the average amount spent per customer reached a new all-time record in the March quarter. \nNext, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4 million Macs compared to 4.6 million last year, a decline of 12%. It was a challenging quarter for personal computer sales across the industry, but we believe we gained market share. Despite the overall market slowdown, we generated double-digit market growth in a number of markets, including Russia, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and the UAE. \nJust last week, we updated the MacBook, our thinnest and lightest Mac, with the latest processors, faster graphics, fastest flash storage, and longer battery life. We think our customers are going to love this update. We ended the quarter within our four to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory. \nTurning to iPad, we sold 10.3 million compared to 12.6 million in the year ago quarter. We also reduced channel inventory by about 200,000 units, and we exited the quarter within our five to seven-week target range. In the same segments of the public market where we compete, we continue to be highly successful. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad had 78% share of the US market for tablets priced above $200. And the latest data published by ABC indicates that iPad accounts for 72% of the US commercial tablet market, comprising business, government, and education. \niPad customer metrics are also extremely positive. In February, 451 Research measured a 97% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Air 2, and among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 59% planned to purchase an iPad, more than 3 times the purchase intention rate of the next highest brand measured. Corporate buyers reported a 94% satisfaction rate for iPad, and a June quarter purchase intent of 71%.""

5,By what percentage did Apple's iPhone revenue increase or decrease in 2023 compared to the previous year?,"Based on the provided context from Apple's financial 10K filing, there is no specific information regarding iPhone revenue for 2023. The context only provides information about Apple's performance in a certain quarter and does not provide information about iPhone revenue for the entire year of 2023.

However, if we look at the overall trend of Apple's Services segment, which includes revenue from App Store, Apple Music, Cloud Services, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and other services, we can see that it had double-digit growth in the quarter being discussed. This suggests that Apple's Services segment is growing strongly, but there is no specific information about iPhone revenue.

 ""Revenue from other products grew 30% over the last year, thanks to Apple Watch. We have expanded distribution to 60 countries, and introduced bands in beautiful new colors for spring, so customers can personalize their watches in more ways, with a range of colors, styles, and materials. Our customers are very happy with Apple Watch, with 451 Research measuring 94% customer satisfaction. \nWe're also making great progress with our enterprise initiatives. IBM now has engagements for more than 200 deployments of native iOS apps for large enterprise customers to accelerate mobile transformation. Our mobility partner program also continues to grow, with 108 partners across 20 countries. \nWe see continued broad industry adoption of native iOS apps to transform how professionals do their work and serve their customers. For example, retail bankers are using iOS apps on iPads to greet and onboard customers, reduce queue times, and improve the customer experience. And in hospitals, using doctors and nurses are using iOS Apps on iPhone and iPad to share and communicate more effectively, so that they can spend more time with patients, and less time on administrative tasks. \nLet me now turn to our cash positions. We ended the quarter with $232.9 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $17.2 billion. $208.9 billion of this cash, or 90% of the total, was outside the United States. \nWe issued $15.5 billion in US dollar denominated notes during the quarter, including our first green bond tranche to fund initiatives such as renewable energy and environmental design projects. We exited the March quarter with $72 billion in term debt. We returned   $10 billion to investors during the quarter, including $2.9 billion in dividends and equivalents, and $7 billion on purchases of 71.8 million Apple shares, to open market transactions. \nWe have now completed over $163 billion of the current $200 billion capital return program, including $117 billion in share repurchases. As Tim mentioned, today we are announcing the latest update to our program, which we are increasing to a total of $250 billion. Once again, we are allocating the majority of the expansion of the program to share repurchases, given our strong confidence in Apple's future, and the value we see in our stock. The Board has increased the share repurchase authorization by $35 billion, raising it from the current $140 billion level to $175 billion. We will also continue to net share settle, less the employee restricted stock units. \nWe also know that the dividend is very important to many of our investors who value income, and we are raising it for the fourth time in less than four years. The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.52 per share to $0.57 per share, an increase of about 10%. This is effective with our next dividend, which the Board has declared today is payable on May 12, 2016, to shareholders of record as of May 9, 2016. \nWe continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. With $12 billion in annual dividend payments, we are proud to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world. In total, with this updated program, during the next eight quarters, we expect to return $87 billion to our investors, which represents about 15% of our market cap at the current stock price. \nAs in the past, we expect to fund our capital return program with US cash, future US cash flow generation and borrowing from both domestic and international debt markets. We will continue to review capital allocation regularly, and solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. This allows us to be thoughtful about the size, the mix, and the face of the program. \nAs we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $41 billion and $43 billion. The revenue guidance implies a year-over-year decline, as we lap an incredibly strong June quarter last year, when revenue grew 33%, due in part to accelerated iPhone upgrade purchases. This tough compare is compounded by the continued weak macro environment this year, and the strong US dollar, which affects our revenue growth in international markets. \nEmbedded in this guidance is a planned channel inventory reduction worth  over $2 billion, as we have elected to be prudent about our channel inventory position, given the current macro environment. The guidance also reflects a range of possible scenarios related to how quickly we can get into supply-demand balance for iPhone SE. Due to these factors, our expected demand is greater than the revenue range implies.""]",0.2,0.0,0.0035842293906810036

7,How has Apple's capital expenditures changed over the past five years?,"The question is actually about Effective tax rate Statutory federal income tax rate, not capital expenditures. To answer your question:

According to the context from financial 10K filings data, here are the effective tax rates and statutory federal income tax rates for Apple Inc. over the past five years (2021, 2020, and 2019):

* 2021: Effective tax rate - 13.3%, Statutory federal income tax rate - 21%. The Company's effective tax rate was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation and foreign-derived intangible income deductions.
* 2020: Effective tax rate - 14.4%, Statutory federal income tax rate - 21%. The Company's effective tax rate was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of tax settlements, and tax benefits from share-based compensation.
* 2019: Effective tax rate - 15.9%, Statutory federal income tax rate - 21%. The Company's effective tax rate was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to changes in unrecognized tax benefits.

Please note that these rates are based on specific years and may not reflect Apple Inc.'s overall trend or current situation.","['Japan\n\nJapan net sales decreased during 2022 compared to 2021 due to the weakness of the yen relative to the U.S. dollar.\n\nRest of Asia Pacific\n\nRest of Asia Pacific net sales increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone, Mac and Services.

We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the ﬁnancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the ﬁnancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the ﬁnancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.\n\nUncertain Tax Positions\n\nDescription of the Matter\n\nAs discussed in Note 7 to the ﬁnancial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to taxation and ﬁles income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2023, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax beneﬁts was $19.5 billion, of which $9.5 billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s eﬀective tax rate. In accounting for some of the uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses signiﬁcant judgment in the interpretation and application of complex domestic and international tax laws.\n\nAuditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the beneﬁt of various tax positions can be complex, involves signiﬁcant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 49\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\nWe tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, management’s process to measure the beneﬁt of its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures.']",0.75,0.0,0.0028653295128939827

But you had mentioned great success in India, I believe, Tim.  In your prepared comments, you mentioned, I think, India had doubled year-over-year. Based upon market analysis, it looks like Apple is still just a relatively small sliver of the pie there. So Tim, what would it take to be even more successful in India? Is it a manufacturing footprint there with your partners? Is it more physical stores? Is it lower price points? Is it the bandwidth that has now caught up to many other countries? Or how should we think about that? And then, the follow-up question is on the AR/VR, when will it really show up in your income statement? Are you hoping more for hardware sales or services to the apps or where the excitement will then be monetized within Apple?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTimothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [28]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn terms of India, many of the things that you mentioned are correct. Growing a market like India is a result of all of those things and doing them all well. And so, it's analogous to the many years that we put into China. It's building stores. It's building channels. It's building markets. It's building the developer ecosystem. It's having the right product lineup for the market. And I feel like we're making good progress there and are gaining understanding of the market, but we still have a long way to go. I don't -- which I sort of see as an opportunity instead of a problem. And I do feel great about the growth rate. And so, that's India. I think it's all of those things. As you know, we -- as I've said, I think we talked about before, we started manufacturing the iPhone SE there 6, 9 months ago. So -- and the majority of iPhone SEs that we sold in the domestic market last quarter were manufactured there. And so we also have that going and are hoping that, that winds up saving some amount of money over time and avoiding some of the compounding of taxes, et cetera. The bandwidth issue has also been an issue, but as you point out, it is being addressed. And between the large carriers there with Bharti and now Jio investing the way they are, the service in India is materially better than it was just 12 months ago. So there's been a sea change there in a short period of time. So I feel good about all that, but we have a long way to go. In terms of the monetization question on AR/VR, we tend to focus first and foremost on customer experience. And so we're all about making sure the experience is great. And we think that if we get the experience right, that revenues and profits will be a result of getting that right. And so we're much -- we're very much focused on the experience right now.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [29]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThat will come from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAmit Jawaharlaz Daryanani,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst    [30]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI have 2 as well.

Western Europe.\n               3. Central and Eastern Europe.\n               4. Rest of Asia Pacific.\n          5. Had record performance in large markets, including:\n               1. US.\n               2. Canada.\n               3. Mexico.\n               4. Germany.\n               5. Italy.\n               6. Spain.\n               7. Korea.\n          6. In the letter shared earlier this month, Co. said it is proud to participate in Chinese marketplace and that it believes AAPL's business has a bright future there over time.\n          7. Generated record Dec. qtr. Services revenue in Greater China, fueled by an amazing ecosystem with over 2.5m registered iOS developers.\n               1. Saw strong results from wearables business, there with revenues up over 50%.\n          8. Continued to grow total active installed base by adding new customers.\n               1. More than two-thirds of all customers in China who bought a Mac or an iPad during Dec. qtr. were purchasing that product for first time.\n          9. Despite challenging Dec. qtr., revenue from China grew slightly for full calendar year.\n               1. Macroeconomic factors will come and go.\n               2. Sees great upside and continuing to focus on things that Co. can control.\n     2. iPhone:\n          1. iPhone XR, iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max are by far the best iPhones Co. has ever shipped.\n               1. They share advanced technologies, including A12 Bionic, the most powerful chip ever in a smartphone with Co.'s next generation Neural Engine capable of 5t operations per second.\n          2. Proud of iPhone lineup, and Co.'s industry-leading customer satisfaction.\n               1. Wouldn't change position for anyone.\n          3. Customers are holding on to their older iPhones a bit longer than in past.\n               1. Pairing this with a macroeconomic factor, particularly in emerging markets, it resulted in iPhone revenue down 15% from last year.\n          4. Results accounted for significantly more than entire YoverY revenue decline.\n               1. Outside of iPhone, business grew strongly, by 19%.\n          5. From a customer perspective, Co. believes [aforementioned] is the sum of several factors.\n               1. FX:\n                    1. Relative strength of US dollar has made Co.'s products more expensive in many parts of world.\n                    2. In Turkey, lira depreciated by 33% over course of calendar 2018 and in Dec. qtr., revenue there was down by almost $700m from previous year.\n               2. Subsidy:\n                    1. For various reasons, iPhone subsidies are becoming increasingly less common.\n                    2. In Japan, iPhone purchases were traditionally subsidized by carriers and bundled with service contract.\n                    3. Competitive promotional activity frequently increased amount of subsidy during key period.\n                    4. Today, local regulations have significantly restricted those subsidies and related competition.\n                    5. Thereby, Co. estimates that less than half of iPhone sold in Japan in 1Q19 were subsidized vs. about three-quarters a year ago and that total value of those subsidies had come down.\n               3. Battery replacement program:\n                    1. For millions of customers, Co. made it inexpensive and efficient to replace battery and hold on to their existing iPhones a bit longer.\n                    2. Some people suggested that Co. shouldn't have done this because of potential impact on upgrades, but Co. strongly believes, it was right thing to do for customers.""

Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [27]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWe think about it very broadly, and you can tell that a bit by some of the things that we've had going with ResearchKit and CareKit and most recently, the health records that I had referenced in my initial comments. And those all came out of getting significantly engaged in the Apple Watch and sort of pulling the strings so to speak. And we also have a Heart Study that is going on currently. And so I don't want to give too much away, but it's an area of great interest where we think we can make a big difference. And so it's a major strategic thrust of ours.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [28]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWe'll go to Brian White with Monness, Crespi.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian John White,  Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [29]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYes. Tim, I think there's -- China numbers were actually phenomenal in the quarter and third consecutive quarter of growth. I think there's been a lot of concerns, just Apple in China and maybe misinformation out there. But what do you see as the drivers for Apple in both Mainland China and Greater China over the next few years? And also, if you could just give us an update on what you're seeing in India.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTimothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [30]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYes, good question. Let me start with India, and then I'll talk more about China. India, we set a new first half record. So we continue to put great energy there and try to -- our objective over time is to go in there with all of our different initiatives from retail and everything else. And so we're working toward those things. It's a huge market, and it's clear that many people will be moving into the middle class over time as we've seen in other countries. China, I continue to believe is a phenomenal country with lots of opportunity from a market point of view but also lots of opportunity from an app developer point of view. We have almost 2 million application developers in China that are writing apps for iOS and the App Store, and they're doing unbelievably creative work and innovative work. And so we sort of -- we look at China holistically, not only as a market. On the market side, we've seen iPhone X, as I had mentioned before, as being the top-selling smartphone during the quarter. We gained share during the quarter. And I read some notes here and there about the market itself not being good. I think on -- in any kind of -- on a 90-day clock, lots of different things can happen, but my own personal view of China is that it's a great market. And I would -- I'm -- we are certainly looking far beyond 90 days and feel very bullish on the opportunity and the environment there. I would say that the market for us is more than iPhone. The Mac gained share there as well. The Watch is getting some traction there. Services is doing extremely well. And so it has several catalysts, and I'm very pleased with the results that we were able to show during the quarter.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [31]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNext we'll hear from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWamsi Mohan,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [32]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTim, can you comment on the price elasticity of demand at the high end for iPhones, if that was in line with your expectations?

 ""--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTimothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [15]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWell, Mike, it's Tim. The -- again, the great thing about Services is there are several services that make up the total that are growing nicely. And I think the other good news is that because our active installed base has -- is at such a level at -- last quarter, we said that we had exceeded $1.3 billion. This year, we're -- we're not going to release this number every quarter, but we've obviously grown again. And it's growing at a double-digit number on a year-over-year basis. And so with that kind of change in the installed base and with the services that we have now and others that we are working on, I think that this is just a huge opportunity for us and feel very good about the track that we're on.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMichael Joseph Olson,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst    [16]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnd then any potential tariff issues aside, what's working for Apple in China right now? You talked about it being the strongest year-over-year growth in 10 quarters. I guess, what's driving that? Is it iPhone X specifically or something else that's behind that improvement?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTimothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [17]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA good question. IPhone X was the most popular smartphone in all of China last quarter. And so iPhone X has done well there. In order to hit a number like 21% on the growth that you see on your data sheet there, there has to be several things working well. And the things that have huge growth rates there are the other products category, which is our Wearables business in China and the Services business, which you and I just spoke about. The iPhone obviously had to do extremely well to get a 21% number, and we gained share in the market for the Mac as well. And so there's actually several vectors there that are working well for us. We also -- more broadly on the iPhone, the iPhone was the top 3 selling phones in China. And so it's iPhone X was #1, but we had several in the top.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [18]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFrom RBC Capital Markets, Amit Daryanani.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAmit Jawaharlaz Daryanani,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst    [19]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTwo questions from me as well. I guess, first one, just touching on the gross margin dynamics. If I look at the guidance for June on a year-over-year basis, I think sales are up double digit, but gross margins are still flat at the high end, maybe down 20 basis points at the midpoint. Can you just talk about what's driving the lack of leverage on the gross margin basis on a year-over-year basis for June?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLuca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [20]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYes. Amit, it's Luca. We tend to look at the -- our gross margin dynamics on a sequential basis, and essentially, we're guiding to about flat on a sequential basis. On a year-over-year basis, it's less relevant for our business, but in general, I would say that this year we are seeing a more difficult cost environment. Particularly, we're still dealing with about 70 basis points of the impact from the memory pricing environment that we're working through.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAmit Jawaharlaz Daryanani,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst    [21]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGot it. And if I could just follow up, Tim, you've been fairly vocal, I think, talking about the need for better privacy protection and well-crafted regulation over time. Could you just maybe help us understand how does Apple protect consumer data? And how does this ongoing debate around data protection translate into a positive for Apple over time?""]",0.0,0.8968584615003777,0.004132231404958678
10,"What was Apple's effective tax rate for 2023, and how does it compare to the previous year?","Based on the provided context from Apple's Form 10-K filing, we can't find the exact information about Apple's effective tax rate for 2023. However, we can provide some insights related to the company's tax situation.

Luca Maestri, CFO of Apple, mentioned that they are not expecting any material impact on their tax situation due to new regulations. He also highlighted that Apple is already paying full US tax on all profits from US sales and doesn't expect these regulations to have an impact.

As for Tim Cook's statement, he expressed optimism about comprehensive corporate tax reform in the United States, but noted that it's difficult to predict when this will occur.

Regarding uncertain tax positions (UTPs), Apple reported a total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits of $16.8 billion as of September 24, 2022, with $8.0 billion being potentially impacted by changes in tax laws or regulations.

To summarize:

* Apple's CFO doesn't expect new regulations to have any material impact on their tax situation.
* The company is already paying full US tax on US profits.
* There are ongoing efforts towards comprehensive corporate tax reform, but the timing is uncertain.
* Apple reported a significant amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits (UTPs) as of September 2022.

I wanted to start with a general, more general question. I guess, Tim, this one is aimed at you. As you think about where you thought things were going to head last quarter, when you reported to us, and how it's changed this quarter, obviously it's kind of a disappointing demand environment. Can you just help us understand what maybe the top two or three things are that have changed? And so as we walk away from this, we understand what the differences are, and what the direction of change is? Then I have a follow-up. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [41]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n           I think you're probably indirectly asking about our trough comment, if you will, from last quarter. And when we made that, we did not contemplate or comprehend that we were going to make a $2 billion-plus reduction in channel inventory during this quarter. So if you factor that in and look at true customer demand, which is the way that we look at internally, I think you'll find a much more reasonable comparison. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRod Hall,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [42]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Okay, great. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, I wanted to ask you about the tax situation a little bit. Treasury obviously has made some rule changes, and I wonder, maybe if Luca, you could comment on what the impact to Apple from those is, if anything? and Tim, maybe more broadly how you see the tax situation for Apple looking forward? Thanks. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLuca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO    [43]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Yes, Rod, these are new regulations, and we are in the processing of assessing them. Frankly from first read, we don't anticipate that they are going to have any material impact on our tax situation. Some of them relate to inversion transactions, obviously that's not an issue for us. Some of them are around internal debt financing, which is not something that we use, so we don't expect any issue there. \nAs you know, we are the largest US taxpayer by a wide margin, and we already pay full US tax on all the profits from the sales that we make in the United States, so we don't expect them to have any impact on us on tax reform. I will let Tim continue to  provide more color, but we've been strong advocates for comprehensive corporate tax reform in this country. We continue to do that. We think a reform of the tax code would have significant benefits for the entire US economy, and we remain optimistic that we are going to get to a point where we can see that tax reform enacted. At that point in time, of course, we would have much more flexibility around optimizing our capital structure, and around providing more return of capital to our investors. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [44]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          The only thing I would add, Rod, is I think there are a growing number of people in both parties that would like to see comprehensive reform, and so I'm optimistic that it will occur. It's just a matter of when and that's difficult to say. But I think most people do recognize that it is in the US's interest to do this. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRod Hall,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [45]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Great, thanks. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNancy Paxton,  Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR    [46]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------""

As of September 24, 2022, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $16.8 billion, of which $8.0 billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s effective tax rate. In accounting for uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses significant judgment in the interpretation and application of complex domestic and international tax laws.\n\nAuditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 50\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\nWe tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures.\n\nTo evaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple Inc.’s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of Apple Inc.’s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also received external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters with external advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel.

In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 24, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated October 27, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nApple Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

11,How much has Apple's net income increased/decreased over the past five years?,"Based on the provided financial data, we can calculate Apple's net income for each year:

2021: Not specified in the data, but according to Apple's 2021 Form 10-K, their net income was $99.8 billion.

2022: According to the data, Apple's net income decreased by 7% or $6.4 billion compared to 2021.

To calculate the percentage change:

((2022 net income - 2021 net income) / 2021 net income) * 100 = -6.4%

So, Apple's net income decreased by 6.4% from 2021 to 2022.

12,"What is Apple's total debt as of 2023, and how does it compare to 2022?","Based on the provided financial data, there is no information available for Apple's total debt as of 2023. The provided data only includes information up to September 24, 2022.

However, we can analyze the debt-related information provided for 2021 and 2020:

* In 2021, Apple had fixed-rate notes with a face value of $6,500 and a weighted-average interest rate ranging from 1.43% to 2.86%.
* The total term debt is not explicitly mentioned, but we can calculate the total debt by adding the debt issuance in Q4 2021 ($14,000) and the debt issuance in 2028-2061 ($6,500).

Assuming these are one-time additions to Apple's debt, the total debt as of September 25, 2021 would be:

$14,000 + $6,500 = $20,500

Since there is no information available for 2023, we cannot determine how Apple's total debt compares to 2022. However, we can analyze the lease liabilities and note that Apple had a total lease liability of $12,411 as of September 24, 2022.","['Apple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 44\n\n2021\n\n10,087 861 10,948\n\n1,449 9,506 79 769 11,803\n\nTotal\n\n1,913 1,872 1,758 1,430 1,177 5,986 14,136 (1,725) 12,411\n\nNote 7 – Debt\n\nCommercial Paper and Repurchase Agreements\n\nThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program.

 'European Commission State Aid Decision\n\nOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act.\n\nOn an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 24, 2022, the adjusted recovery amount was €12.7 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings.

 ""================================================================================\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\n================================================================================\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [1]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYes. That will be from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAmit Jawaharlaz Daryanani,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Fundamental Research Analyst    [2]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI guess first one for me. On Wearables, fairly impressive to see it's already a $10 billion business for you guys. Can you just touch on the growth that you see on the Wearables side? How much of the growth do you think is coming from first-time buyers of AirPods or Apple Watch versus folks that seem to be just upgrading the products that they have? Because it looks to us adoption rates are fairly low in your installed base so there should be a long runway, but love to just understand how you see the growth divided between those 2 buckets.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTimothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [3]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYes. Amit, it's Tim. If you look at the Apple -- or the Wearables as a category within the Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue, Wearables grew 44%, so it was very strong, as you say. The -- both Apple Watch and AirPods did very well in terms of collecting new customers. Apple Watch, in particular, 75% of the customers are new to the Apple Watch, and so it's still very much selling to new customers at this point.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAmit Jawaharlaz Daryanani,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Fundamental Research Analyst    [4]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPerfect. And I guess, Luca, if you could just touch on gross margins. The March quarter guide, I think, implies gross margins are flat to actually up 10, 15 basis points. It's rare for you guys to actually guide gross margins up in March, I think, because you have a fairly high seasonal sales deleverage happening. So what are the offsets that's enabling what looks like a better-than-seasonal guide for gross margins?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLuca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [5]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYes, that's right, Amit. It's about flat sequentially and, by the way, significantly higher on a year-over-year basis. But on a sequential basis, you're right. On one side, we got the loss of leverage from the usual seasonality, but we expect that, that loss of leverage will be offset by better mix and cost savings.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTejas Gala,  Apple Inc. - IR Contact    [6]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThank you, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator    [7]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThat will come from Tom Forte with D.A. Davidson.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThomas Ferris Forte,  D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [8]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGreat. So congrats on the launch of Apple TV+. I wanted to know internally how you are gauging success. Is it purely on critical acclaim? Is it on number of consumers that are using the service, contribution of service revenue, et cetera, et cetera?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTimothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [9]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTom, it's Tim. We are primarily measuring ourselves on the number of subscribers. As you can tell from the way that we launched the product, we started with a very aggressive price at $4.99. And in addition to that, we have our bundle, where if you buy pretty much any device, you're getting a year for free, and so we're very focused on subscribers. That said, our -- the product itself is about storytelling. And we think if we do that well, then we'll find that there will be some number of those that will also be critically acclaimed and we're seeing that with The Morning Show. We're seeing that with Little America and others.""
 'COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nCertain of the Company’s outsourcing partners, component suppliers and logistical service providers have experienced disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in supply shortages.

14,"How much was Apple's dividend per share for 2023, and how does it compare to the previous year?","Based on the provided financial statements, we can find the information about dividends declared in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity.

For the year ended September 30, 2023:

* Net income: $96,652
* Dividends and dividend equivalents declared: $(14,996)

For the year ended September 24, 2022:

* Net income: $99,803
* Dividends and dividend equivalents declared: $(14,793)

To find the dividend per share, we need to know the number of shares outstanding. Unfortunately, this information is not provided in the given statements. However, we can calculate the total dividends paid as follows:

2023:
$(14,996) / ? = dividend per share (assuming the same number of shares)

2022:
$(14,793) / ? = dividend per share (assuming the same number of shares)

To compare the dividend per share between 2023 and 2022, we would need to know the number of shares outstanding in both years.","['During 2021, aspects of the Company’s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the Company’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and a significant number of the Company’s employees working remotely.
