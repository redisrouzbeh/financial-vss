However, lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. If we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, designs, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories or lower profit margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns, including social media and other digital advertising networks. If we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\nWe rely on technical innovation and high-quality products to compete in the market for our products.'}]"

For fiscal 2022 and 2021, non-U.S. NIKE Brand and Converse sales represented 60% and 61% of total revenues respectively. NIKE sells products through NIKE Direct operations, independent distributors, licensees, and sales representatives globally. Products are shipped from 67 distribution centers outside the U.S., refer to Item 2. Properties for more details on distribution facilities. During fiscal 2023, NIKE's top three non-U.S. customers made up around 14% of total non-U.S. sales.

No single customer contributed 10% or more to the consolidated net revenues during fiscal 2023. Research, design, and development efforts are crucial for NIKE, focusing on technical innovation in footwear, apparel, and athletic equipment. NIKE employs specialists in various fields and collaborates with athletes, coaches, and experts for product development and compliance.\",\n",
              " \"The company focuses on designing innovative products and experiences by incorporating new technologies in various product categories and consumer applications. Market intelligence and research are utilized by different design teams to identify opportunities for integrating new technologies into existing product categories based on consumer preferences. The company's dedication to designing innovative products is exemplified by the use of technologies like Nike Air, Zoom, Free, Dri-FIT, Flyknit, FlyEase, ZoomX, Air Max, React, and Forward. Nearly all footwear and apparel products are manufactured outside the United States by independent manufacturers known as contract manufacturers. The company is supplied by numerous 'Tier 2' suppliers who provide the principal materials used in footwear and apparel finished goods products. As of May 31, 2023, the company had 146 strategic Tier 2 suppliers. As of May 31, 2023, the company's contract manufacturers operated 123 finished goods footwear factories in 11 countries. In fiscal 2023, NIKE Brand footwear finished goods were manufactured by 15 contract manufacturers, with the largest single finished goods footwear factory contributing around 9% of total production. Vietnam, Indonesia, and China manufactured approximately 50%, 27%, and 18% of total NIKE Brand footwear in fiscal 2023, respectively. Four footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for over 10% of footwear production in fiscal 2023, totaling approximately 58% of NIKE Brand footwear production. As of May 31, 2023, the company's contract manufacturers operated 291 finished goods apparel factories in 31 countries. In fiscal 2023, NIKE Brand apparel finished goods were manufactured by 55 contract manufacturers, where the largest single finished goods apparel factory contributed approximately 8% of total production. In fiscal 2023, Vietnam, China, and Cambodia manufactured around 29%, 18%, and 16% of total NIKE Brand apparel, respectively.\",\n",
              " \"In fiscal 2023, one apparel contract manufacturer produced more than 10% of NIKE Brand apparel, while the top five contract manufacturers together produced around 52% of NIKE Brand apparel. NIKE's contract manufacturers purchase raw materials for manufacturing footwear, apparel, and equipment, acquiring most raw materials locally where production occurs. The primary materials in NIKE footwear include natural and synthetic rubber, plastics, foams, leather, nylon, polyester, textiles, and polyurethane films for Air-Sole cushioning components. Air Manufacturing Innovation and contract manufacturers in China and Vietnam supplied NIKE Air-Sole cushioning components in fiscal 2023. The main materials in NIKE apparel are natural and synthetic fabrics, yarns (both virgin and recycled), performance fabrics for moisture-wicking and weather protection, and plastic and metal hardware. During fiscal 2023, NIKE faced supply chain volatility early in the year, with gradually improving conditions and increased network costs due to inflation. Despite challenges, contract manufacturers successfully sourced enough raw materials for NIKE footwear and apparel products in fiscal 2023. Sojitz Corporation of America, a large Japanese trading company, has provided import-export financing services to NIKE since 1972 and is the sole owner of NIKE's redeemable preferred stock. The sourcing risks affecting NIKE's business due to supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of the financial report. NIKE's international operations and trade involve working with contract manufacturers in various countries to produce their products.\",\n",
              " \"NIKE's international operations are subject to risks of doing business abroad, such as trade policy changes, import duties, quotas, and political instability. NIKE has not been significantly impacted by these risks so far, but cannot predict future effects. Global economic and political uncertainties have led to increased protectionist actions worldwide. The footwear and apparel industries, including NIKE, are impacted by trade protectionism. NIKE collaborates with industry groups to address trade issues and comply with competition laws. Despite efforts to mitigate impact, protectionist measures have increased NIKE's product costs. Further measures could negatively affect NIKE's sales and profitability, as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry.\"]"
