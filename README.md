*A detailed notebook to teach semantic search and RAG patterns over public financial 10k documents with different Redis clients and integrations including: [redis-py](https://redis-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), [redisvl](https://redisvl.com), and [langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/redis).*

# âš¡ Introduction to Vector Search in Redis
[Redis](https://redis.com), widely recognized for its low-latency performance, extends beyond traditional noSQL databases. It's uniquely suited for tasks like caching, session management, job queuing, and JSON storage. With enhanced Search+Query features, Redis emerges as a performant [Vector Database](https://redis.com/solutions/use-cases/vector-database) supporting Vector Search over unstructured data encoded as embeddings.
